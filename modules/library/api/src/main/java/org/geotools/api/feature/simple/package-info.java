/**
 * Profile of the general ISO 19107 feature model built around the idea of a simple feature composed
 * of a list of values.
 *
 * <p>A {@link SimpleFeature} is a wrapper around a list of values. The values are interpreted based
 * on order; and must be supplied in exactly the the order indicated by the {@link
 * SimpleFeatureType}.
 *
 * <p><center><img src="doc-files/simple.GIF"></center>
 *
 * <p>This model matches the assumptions of GeoAPI 2.1 and is applicable in a wide range of
 * applications from the representation of shapefiles; to simple database tables (with no external
 * references).
